# About RFPS Icons

This repository is used for creating simple icons and other images using Python's *Pillow* library. 

All icons are generated as white-on-transparent PNG images.

Images are generated in high resolution and then downscaled to 100x100 pixels.

## How to run
1. **Install requirements** : `make install`
2. **Generate images** : `make run`

## Documentation
- **Create documentation** : `make doc`
- **Count lines of code** : `make cloc`

Run Doxygen after image generation to see them in HTML documentation.
