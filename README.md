# About RFPS Icons

This repository is used for creating simple icons and other images using Python's *Pillow* library. 

All icons are generated as white-on-transparent PNG images.

Images are generated in high resolution and then downscaled to 100x100 pixels.

## How to run
1. **Install requirements** : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Generate images** : `python3 main.py`

## Documentation
- **Create documentation** : `doxygen Doxyfile`
- **Count lines of code** : `cloc . --include-lang=Python`

Run Doxygen after image generation to see them in HTML documentation.
