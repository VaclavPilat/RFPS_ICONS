# RFPS Icons

This repository is used for creating simple icons and other images using Python's *Pillow* library. 

Images are generated in high resolution and then downscaled to 100x100 pixels.

## How to run

- **Install requirements** : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Generate images** : `python3 main.py`

## Documentation

- **Create documentation** : `doxygen Doxyfile`

Run Doxygen after image generation to see them in HTML documentation.
